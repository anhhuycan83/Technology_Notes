Hashing is used when we need to represent a lsrge chunk of data with a csertainspecified bits or bytes of data . 

1. Applications --> multilingual dbs . 
2. downloads fails if server sent hash does noy matches with clinet hash  

Properties of good hash function : 

1. impossible for collisions . 
2. even if smallest of bits is chnaged the entire hash must be chnaged . 



SHa-2 is present and future standard for hashing . It can generate hashes of 256 , 128 , 512 bits  . Its the strongest . 
Alsp sha-3 is uwnder research and testing .
