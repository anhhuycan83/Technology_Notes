1.Run command for no recordng and highly effircient usage :

--no-request-journal: Disable the request journal, which records incoming requests for later verification. 
This allows WireMock to be run (and serve stubs) for long periods (without resetting) without exhausting the heap. 
The --record-mappings option isnâ€™t available if this one is specified.

--disable-request-logging: Prevent requests and responses from being sent to the notifier. 
Use this when performance testing as it will save memory and CPU even when info/verbose logging is not enabled. --- not working

--disable-gzip: Prevent response bodies from being gzipped.

--use-chunked-encoding: Set the policy for sending responses with Transfer-Encoding: chunked. Valid values are always, never and body_file.
 The last of these will cause chunked encoding to be used only when a stub defines its response body from a file.
